# Customer-Segmentation-Mall-Shoppers-Python
Welcome to the Customer Segmentation Analysis project, where I explore unsupervised machine learning techniques to gain insights into the mall's customer base. The primary goal is to segment the market into distinct customer groups based on income, age, and mall shopping score. This analysis helps the marketing team to fine-tune their strategies for more effective targeting.

## Project Highlights

- **Problem Statement:** This project addresses the need to understand customer segmentation better, providing insights into the characteristics of different customer groups.

- **Tools and Techniques:** Python and Jupyter Notebook are the primary tools used for data analysis, and K-means clustering is applied to segment the customers. Visualizations and summary statistics are used to interpret the results.

- **Key Findings:**
    - Identified distinct customer clusters, including a high-income and high-spending target group.
    - Explored the demographics and behaviors of each cluster to tailor marketing efforts more effectively.
    - Discovered opportunities to market to different customer segments with specific campaigns.

## Repository Contents

- **Data:** The dataset used for the analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Contains the Python code and analysis walkthrough.
- **Visualizations:** Visual representations of the customer clusters.
- **Summary Statistics:** Key statistics about each customer segment.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude for the resources and knowledge that have contributed to this project. This analysis was a personal exploration of data segmentation and machine learning techniques.
